0.This is my project for ece1778.
1.Augmented Module is referenced from QCAR package from Vuforia
2.Please download the QCAR package and NDK package and put them in the same folder where folder ece1778 lives
3.The application gives a step-by-step display of components of an x3d object and an augmented module displaying such object. Yet for the augmented reality part the light source seems odd.
4. Anyway, enjoy!
